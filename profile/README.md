## üìñ Open source
Everything should be open source this way privacy and security can be audited and verified, that's why we are open to the public if you find an issue why not open an issue and help out the development ecosystem.

## üí≥ Licensing
Open source technology is the backbone of development and advances however it comes at a cost, as this code is open source we have to put a license to stop companies taking our code and using it in a private use essentially stealing our platform that's why we have issued out the `AGPL-3.0` learn more about this license [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

## üïµÔ∏è Code names
We use codenames to easily identify services and features for example if a non-technical user reports an issue we don't know if this issue is coming from the web server or the mobile app so adding codenames allows us to identify services faster and more optimally. With codenames we can standardize versions and packages for example `Toad-v1.0`, there are 4 codenames `Toad`, `Bullfrog`, `Heqet`, and `Coqui`.
